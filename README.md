# Number-Theory-and-Cryptography
This is inspired by the course Math 4351, "Number Theory and Cryptography", 
as taught at Washington University in St. Louis in Spring 2015.  

I put material here that is inspired by reading and/or useful for homework. 
Where the latter is concerned, I also upload this so that course instructors can verify some of my computer-assisted work.
The code's primary function is academic and/or explorational.  While I haven't tried to go overboard in making it industrial-grade per se, 
I have cleaned it up somewhat so that it is hopefully reasonably readable.
